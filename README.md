**Project README - Game Data Analysis with Fuzzy Cleaning**

# Game Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive data analysis on the "Game.xlsx" dataset using various data engineering techniques, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains information about various games and their attributes. The analysis includes outlier detection, assessing the normality of distributions, comparing standard normal distribution with the dataset distribution, calculating confidence intervals, and extracting valuable insights from the data.

## Project Goals

- Perform data engineering  on the datasets available in the "FuzzyCleaning" folder.
- Analyze the "Game.xlsx" dataset using exploratory data analysis techniques.
- Detect outliers in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
- Assess the normality of distributions in the dataset.
- Compare the dataset distribution with the standard normal distribution.
- Calculate confidence intervals for selected features.
- Derive meaningful insights from the game dataset.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
3. Place the "Game.xlsx.xlsx" and "Task1.xlsx" files in the project root folder.
4. Place all datasets to be used for Fuzzy Cleaning in the "FuzzyCleaning" folder.
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open "EDA_on_Game.ipynb".
6. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the data analysis pipeline.
7. The notebook will generate visualizations and insights based on the analysis.

## Results and Findings

The analysis of the "Game.xlsx" dataset revealed interesting findings, including:

- Identification of outliers and their appropriate handling methods.
- Assessment of the normality of key distributions in the dataset.
- Comparison of the dataset distribution with the standard normal distribution.
- Calculation of confidence intervals for specific features.
- Extracted valuable insights and trends from the game data.

## Conclusion

The data analysis conducted in this project provides valuable insights into the characteristics of the games dataset. The  data analysis techniques allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions, which can be utilized for further decision-making processes in the gaming industry.
